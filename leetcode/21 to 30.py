Given the array of integers nums, you will choose two different indices i and j of that array. Return the maximum value of (nums[i]-1)*(nums[j]-1).
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,2]
Output: 12 
Explanation: If you choose the indices i=1 and j=2 (indexed from 0), you will get the maximum value, that is, (nums[1]-1)*(nums[2]-1) = (4-1)*(5-1) = 3*4 = 12. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,5,4,5]
Output: 16
Explanation: Choosing the indices i=1 and j=3 (indexed from 0), you will get the maximum value of (5-1)*(5-1) = 16.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,7]
Output: 12

class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        return (nums[len(nums) - 1]-1)*(nums[len(nums) - 2]-1)

Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and a searchWord.

You have to check if searchWord is a prefix of any word in sentence.

Return the index of the word in sentence where searchWord is a prefix of this word (1-indexed).

If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word return -1.

A prefix of a string S is any leading contiguous substring of S.

Example 1:
Input: sentence = "i love eating burger", searchWord = "burg"
Output: 4
Explanation: "burg" is prefix of "burger" which is the 4th word in the sentence.

Example 2:
Input: sentence = "this problem is an easy problem", searchWord = "pro"
Output: 2
Explanation: "pro" is prefix of "problem" which is the 2nd and the 6th word in the sentence, but we return 2 as it's the minimal index.

Example 3:
Input: sentence = "i am tired", searchWord = "you"
Output: -1
Explanation: "you" is not a prefix of any word in the sentence.

Example 4:
Input: sentence = "i use triple pillow", searchWord = "pill"
Output: 4

Example 5:
Input: sentence = "hello from the other side", searchWord = "they"
Output: -1
 
Constraints:
1 <= sentence.length <= 100
1 <= searchWord.length <= 10
sentence consists of lowercase English letters and spaces.
searchWord consists of lowercase English letters.

There are n cities numbered from 0 to n-1 and n-1 roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.

Roads are represented by connections where connections[i] = [a, b] represents a road from city a to b.

This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city 0), and many people want to travel to this city.

Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city 0. Return the minimum number of edges changed.

It's guaranteed that each city can reach the city 0 after reorder.

Example 1:
Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).

Example 2:
Input: n = 5, connections = [[1,0],[1,2],[3,2],[3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).

Example 3:
Input: n = 3, connections = [[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: 0

Constraints:
2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
connections.length == n-1
connections[i].length == 2
0 <= connections[i][0], connections[i][1] <= n-1
connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]

Given an array of integers arr and an integer k.

A value arr[i] is said to be stronger than a value arr[j] if |arr[i] - m| > |arr[j] - m| where m is the median of the array.
If |arr[i] - m| == |arr[j] - m|, then arr[i] is said to be stronger than arr[j] if arr[i] > arr[j].

Return a list of the strongest k values in the array. return the answer in any arbitrary order.

Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. More formally, if the length of the list is n, the median is the element in position ((n - 1) / 2) in the sorted list (0-indexed).

For arr = [6, -3, 7, 2, 11], n = 5 and the median is obtained by sorting the array arr = [-3, 2, 6, 7, 11] and the median is arr[m] where m = ((5 - 1) / 2) = 2. The median is 6.
For arr = [-7, 22, 17, 3], n = 4 and the median is obtained by sorting the array arr = [-7, 3, 17, 22] and the median is arr[m] where m = ((4 - 1) / 2) = 1. The median is 3.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [5,1]
Explanation: Median is 3, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [5,1,4,2,3]. The strongest 2 elements are [5, 1]. [1, 5] is also accepted answer.
Please note that although |5 - 3| == |1 - 3| but 5 is stronger than 1 because 5 > 1.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,1,3,5,5], k = 2
Output: [5,5]
Explanation: Median is 3, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [5,5,1,1,3]. The strongest 2 elements are [5, 5].

Example 3:
Input: arr = [6,7,11,7,6,8], k = 5
Output: [11,8,6,6,7]
Explanation: Median is 7, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [11,8,6,6,7,7].
Any permutation of [11,8,6,6,7] is accepted.

Example 4:
Input: arr = [6,-3,7,2,11], k = 3
Output: [-3,11,2]

Example 5:
Input: arr = [-7,22,17,3], k = 2
Output: [22,17]
 

Constraints:
1 <= arr.length <= 10^5
-10^5 <= arr[i] <= 10^5
1 <= k <= arr.length

Given a rectangular cake with height h and width w, and two arrays of integers horizontalCuts and verticalCuts where horizontalCuts[i] is the distance from the top of the rectangular cake to the ith horizontal cut and similarly, verticalCuts[j] is the distance from the left of the rectangular cake to the jth vertical cut.

Return the maximum area of a piece of cake after you cut at each horizontal and vertical position provided in the arrays horizontalCuts and verticalCuts. Since the answer can be a huge number, return this modulo 10^9 + 7.
