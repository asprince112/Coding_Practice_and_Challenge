This is a web scrapping practice

Web source : The Photo Forum, https://www.thephotoforum.com/


In the sbdirectory (Landscape & Cityscape), first you choose the target page you want to scrap,
then it will automatically filter out articles with more than 200 views, go to each article to 
find links to all photos, and combine with the title and the number of views, the final output 
is a list which is sorted by number of views.
