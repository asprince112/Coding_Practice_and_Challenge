This is a web scrapping practice

Web source : The Photo Forum, https://www.thephotoforum.com/


In the sbdirectory (Landscape & Cityscape), first you choose the target page you want to scrap,
then it will automatically filter out articles with more than 200 views, then go to each article to 
find links to all photos, and combine with the title and the number of views, write to a new 
HTML file which is sorted by number of views.
